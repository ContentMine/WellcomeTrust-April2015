# Extension projects

These are projects which could form the basis of group (or solo) work at the workshops. They are feasible, at least in part and valuable

## Scrapers

### Hindawi

This CC-BY publisher has a large set of journals all created with the same technology and of high quality. Example 
http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ija/2015/426387/ 
from their agronomy journal.

NOTE: The XML is not directly visible so cannot be scraped with `quickscrape` 

### Acta Crystallographica

Very high quality (crystallographic) publishing. Acta Cryst E (http://journals.iucr.org/e/ ) is CC-BY. 
Excellent for developing template-based fact extractions.

### Repository (OAI) 

It may be useful to scrape OAI repositories or CORE.

## AMI plugins

### Licence and metadata

Strong need for this (the Winnower has offered help). Should be possible to start by using `regex` and `identifier` plugins 
without developing code. When the project is scoped we may need a specific plugin - PMR can create a shell. Will need Eclipse/Java developer
but no heavy programming.
